3. Why Choose Cloud Platform For Development?

In our project we utilize Cloud for two things.

    1. As an infrastructure to host our applications (IaaS)

      - Managing on-prem infrastructure is a complex and also high cost task. 

      - Needs a lot of effort(dedicated teams) and cost to maintain the potentially required scalability and availability metrics.

    2. As a Software Service platform (SaaS) 

      - Building high accuracy and high performance Machine Learning models from the scratch needs a lot of effort and time as well as cost. As a result, using a managed service gives a lot of benefits.
